    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
        <p><b>I have hands-on experience scaling a mission-critical product at some of the fastest-growing companies in the world. </b></p>
        <h2>About me</h2>
           <p>My experience encompasses optimizing operations, automating workflows and scaling processes on hypergrowth companies.</p>
           <p>My background is in international business and data analysis and I bridge the gaps betweem product, strategy, engineering and ops.</p>
           <p>I am fluent in 3 languages and learning a 4th currently.</p>
           <p>I can analyze data and make the most of LLMs, prompt enginneering and emerging technologies.</p> 
           <p>I am an advocate for AI and believe it is a force multiplier for any business, not a a human replacement. This is how you become competitive against some of the biggest players.</p>   
           <p>My personality type is INTP and I deeply value intellectual stimulation, freedom, and the opportunity to solve complex problems.</p>
           <p>I was a competitive amateur boxer for 4 years and I am currently learning and getting into mountaineering. I also like to ride motorcycles.</p> 
           <p>Current goals in life: summit a 4000 meter peak, learn kickboxing, deepen my knowledge in management/tech and be the best version of myself for my loved ones.</p>
           <p>Why the simple design for this website? Makes it available if there isn't a high speed interenct connection, mobile-friendly, can be searched using browser seach tools and everything is one-click away.</p>
